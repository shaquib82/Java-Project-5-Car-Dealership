# Java-Project-5-Car-Dealership
There are 3 files - Car, Dealership and Main. 
Car class is the class which aids in maintaining all the data of a car which is in the dealership.
Dealership is basically an array of Car class. An object(cars) is created of the array. It helps in accessing and getting information of all the cars. 
Main is the main java file. Here both the other classes are used to form objects and the project is finalised here.
